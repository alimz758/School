I have included all the needed files, lab4b.c, Makefile, and README
Mainly in lab4b.c after handling the options passed to the executable, I initialize the button and temp to read date and Iprint the desired temp with the time then real line to process START, STOP, SCALE, PERIOD and log accordingly.
My main struggle was interacting with BB, and using poll() and AIO,GPIO

Files included are lab1a.c, Makefile, and this README file that containes the inforamtion of each file and their funcationalities.


To summarize the .c file:
Implementation for --rdonly, --wronly, --verbose, and --command.
Returns 0 if all options work, 1 if one fails.
If one option fails, will skip and continue with other options.
If verbose is called twice, it will print out "--verbose" for the second one.
If verbose flag it set and missing a rd-/wr-only file, then it will print
the error first before the option name
I included the rest of the flags for this part, inclduing profile even though wasn't part of this, I did it because of the midterm for the next week.

Makefile would create the executable, it will create tar file, and it will clean all the extra files


For lab1c, --profile is added, there is a pdf file as well.
I've inlcuded three scripts, dashTest.dash, bashTest.bash, simpshTest.sh for lab1c to check the result for three version

For more details check the report

Due to having the midterm at the same I could not spend much time finding issues regarding my code and scripts

Used the followings for the refrence for dash scripting, and help of friends

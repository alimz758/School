QUESTION 2.1.1 - causing conflicts:
Why does it take many iterations before errors are seen?
Why does a significantly smaller number of iterations so seldom fail?




QUESTION 2.1.2 - cost of yielding:
Why are the --yield runs so much slower?
Where is the additional time going?
Is it possible to get valid per-operation timings if we are using the --yield option?
If so, explain how. If not, explain why not.



QUESTION 2.1.3 - measurement errors:
Why does the average cost per operation drop with increasing iterations?
If the cost per iteration is a function of the number of iterations, how do we know how many iterations to run (or what the "correct" cost is)?




QUESTION 2.1.4 - costs of serialization:
Why do all of the options perform similarly for low numbers of threads?
Why do the three protected operations slow down as the number of threads rises?

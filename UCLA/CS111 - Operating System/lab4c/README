For this lab my main struggle was making the TCP to work, tls was rather easier since it;s built on top of tcp.
I have added the Makefile, READEME and lab4c_tls.c and lab4c_tcp.c
The two .c codes are based off the lab4b with the newly added functionality
It passes the script, I tested on my BBG.


NOTE: I wrote my code on Visual Studio Code then copy/pasted on Vi on my BBG. Then made the DIST on BBG, then SCPied to my computer to upload on CCLE. 
The copy/pasting made the format of the lab4c_tls.c and lab4c_tcp.c a little bit messed up.
